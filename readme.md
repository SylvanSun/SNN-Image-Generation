## Introduction


The contributions of this project are as follows:
- We compared various types of Generators and Discriminators in the GAN framework, and found that the SNN-based Generator


## Installation

### Getting start

Clone our repository:

```shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/SylvanSun/Auto-SNN-for-ICG.git
$ cd Auto-SNN-for-ICG
```

Set up a new environment:

```shell
$ conda env create -f environment.yaml
$ conda activate snnigc
```

### Download assets and process data

We use default datasets as provided by pytorch. Simply run our scripts for the standard training procedure, the datasets will be downloaded automatically.

The folder `data/` should look like this:

```
data
├── cifar-10-batches-py/
│   └── ...
└── MNIST/
    └── ...
```


## Explanation for the scripts
